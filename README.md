Modrunner is a Discord bot that allows server members to search for projects on CurseForge and Modrinth, and server admins to track changes to projects on these platforms, and get notified whenever a tracked projec recieves an update.

Modrunner is currently in **open beta**. This means that while most of the bot's functions have been tested, they may still contain bugs, or many not be 100% complete.

Here's some of the features that are completed or mostly completed:
- Modrinth search: find projects on Modrinth and get basic information on them, posted right into Discord
