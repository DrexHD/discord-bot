# Introduction

## What is Modrunner?

Modrunner is a Discord bot for finding information and monitoring for updates of Minecraft projects hosted on popular hosting sites like CurseForge and Modrinth. You can search for projects, and add projects to tracking to receive updates in Discord when these projects get updates.

## Why Modrunner?

Modrunner is designed to be intuitive to use and painless to set up. Searching for mods is as simple as using the search bar on CurseForge or Modrinth: just type in what you want to find and Modrunner will find it for you. If you're looking for project update notifications, once you add your favorite projects to tracking, you can leave Modrunner alone and it will do the rest automatically for you!
