# List

Get a list of all the projects that are currently in tracking for your server, along with their names, project IDs and the channel their updates are being posted to.

## Command

`/list [channel]`

Returns a list of all projects currently being tracked for the entire server. If a channel is provided, it will return all the projects tracked in that channel.

:::tip

You can tell if a project is being tracked on CurseForge or Modrinth by looking at its ID. Modrinth project IDs are composed of both letters and numbers, while CurseForge IDs are only numbers.

:::

:::info

You will be limited to tracking a maximum of 100 projects per server. If you need more than this, come talk to us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt).
