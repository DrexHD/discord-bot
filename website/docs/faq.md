# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Modrunner?

Modrunner is a Discord bot that allows server members to easily and quickly search popular Minecraft mod hosting platforms for project information and get that information posted directly into Discord, as well as allowing server administrators to track projects and get notifications posted to a Discord server channel when tracked projects receive updates to their files.

## Is Modrunner free?

Modrunner is, and always will be, completely free to use. If you've got extra cash laying around and you think Modrunner is pretty neat, feel free to support me on BuyMeACoffee.

## How can I invite Modrunner to my server?

Use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=978413985722404924&permissions=2048&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

## I noticed something strange or broken about Modrunner. Where can I report this?

The best way is to make an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/beans-squared/modrunner-bot/issues). Otherwise, you can also [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt) and ask in the Modrunner discussion channel.

## Can you make Modrunner do X feature?

Probably. 'Will we make Modrunner do X feature?' is a better question. If you have ideas or suggestions for Modrunner features feel free to post them [in our Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt).

## Is Modrunner an official CurseForge or Modrinth project? Do you work at/with CurseForge or Modrinth?

No, Modrunner is purely a personal project that I work on by myself in my spare time. CurseForge and Modrinth are not affiliated with Modrunner in any way and I do not work for or with either.

## Why did you make Modrunner when alternatives already exist?

Most bots that provide similar functionality I've been personally disappointed with, as they either require self-hosting to work or are offline half the time. I created Modrunner to solve these problems and provide an easy-to-use reliable bot.

## Modrunner does't quite have what I'm looking for. Can you add it?

I'm always open to feedback and looking for ways to improve and add new functionality to Modrunner. Please let me know these things [in our Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt). Chances are, I'm already working on it as well. Check the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/tNrFYngk) to see what I'm currently developing.

If you're looking for quick alternatives, the only other bot I would recommend is [Claptrap](https://claptrapbot.me/) by HypherionSA. This mod offers similar tracking functionality to Modrunner, and includes ATLauncher, Forge, Fabric and Minecraft release tracking as well.
